**Specification Pattern in Entity Framework Core**
This project demonstrates how to use the Specification pattern in Entity Framework Core to build modular and extensible queries for your data access layer.

What is the Specification pattern?
The Specification pattern is a design pattern that allows you to encapsulate complex query logic into a reusable object. A specification is an object that represents a query criteria, and can be composed with other specifications to create more complex queries. The Specification pattern can help you to write more modular and maintainable code, and can make it easier to test your queries.

How to use the Specification pattern in Entity Framework Core
To use the Specification pattern in Entity Framework Core, you can create a base Specification<TEntity> class that defines the criteria, includes, and ordering options for your query. You can then create specific query specifications by inheriting from the base Specification<TEntity> class and adding additional criteria, includes, and ordering options as needed.

Here's an example of how to create a specific query specification for a Product entity:
```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq.Expressions;
using SpecificationPatternInEfCore.Entity;
using SpecificationPatternInEfCore.Specifications;

public class ProductSpecification : Specification<Product>
{
    public ProductSpecification(string name)
    {
        Criteria = p => p.Name == name;
        AddInclude(p => p.Category);
        SetOrderBy(p => p.Price);
    }
}
```
In this example, we've created a ProductSpecification class that inherits from the base Specification<Product> class. We've added a constructor that takes a name parameter and sets the criteria for the query to match products with the specified name. We've also added an include for the Category navigation property, and set the ordering to be by Price.

To use this specification in a query, you can create a new instance of the ProductSpecification class and pass it to the SpecificationBuilder.GetQuery method:

```csharp
using System.Linq;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using SpecificationPatternInEfCore.Entity;
using SpecificationPatternInEfCore.Specifications;

// Assume we have a DbContext called MyDbContext that contains a DbSet<Product> called Products

// Create a new instance of the ProductSpecification class
var specification = new ProductSpecification("Widget");

// Get the query for Products using the specification
var query = SpecificationBuilder.GetQuery(
    context.Products.AsQueryable(),
    specification
);

// Execute the query and get the results
var results = await query.ToListAsync();
```

In this example, we've created a new instance of the ProductSpecification class that matches products with the name "Widget". We've then used the SpecificationBuilder.GetQuery method to get the query for Products using the specification, and executed the query using the ToListAsync method.

Prerequisites
To create the table schema for this project, you can use the Entity Framework Core migration command. First, ensure that you have installed the Entity Framework Core tools by running the following command:

```sql
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

Next, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to create the initial migration:

```sql
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
```

This will create a new migration file in the Migrations folder that contains the necessary code to create the table schema for your entities. Finally, run the following command to apply the migration to your database:

```sql
dotnet ef database update
```

This will create the tables in your database and apply any necessary changes to the schema.

Conclusion
The Specification pattern is a powerful tool that can help you to write more modular and maintainable code in your data access layer. By encapsulating complex query logic into reusable objects, you can create more flexible and extensible queries that are easier to test and maintain.
